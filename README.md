# BP Directory Example

This is a basic example demonstrating a user directory listing.

## Prerequisites:

You should at least have a MongoDB instance up with a collection "wildduck.users" in it.

Even more ideally, you should have a [WildDuck](https://github.com/nodemailer/wildduck) server running.
